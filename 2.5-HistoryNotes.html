      <p> Americas first constitution -  The Articles of Conferation.
      </p>
      <h3> Articles of Confederation (AOC) - </h3>
      <p>The Americans use this to make the french think that they were conpletely independant and self ruling, to get supplies.</p>
      <p>Drafted in 1777 and ratified by all the states in 1781 and put into action, created a central united governing power, but it is much smaller and weaker.</p>
      <p> To sum up - It created a weak cenntral government and strong states, unicameral legislature, one chambered legislature where each state gets one vote by its representative. </p>
      <p>The central government gets to raise and maintain an army, but they cannot get funding for it because it does not have the rights to tax the people, only the states did</p>
      <p>The people did not like to be taxed by the British so when they broke off they refused to tax the people with a central governemnt and have the same type of taxing as Britian, states also had the rights to set importation taxes from not only other copuntries but other states</p>
      <h3>New Land and State Hardships - </h3>
      <p>American states are now in heavy debt, some states have a lot of land and some have little. Some states say they should get the newfound land coming in from the war. Some of the states have laws saying every peice of land westward of them is their territory, the smaller states are angry that the bigger states that have access to the new territory can just sell it off and regain their debt.</p>
      <p>The Northwest Ordinance - A rule by the federal government came up solving this exact problem; If there is newly aquired territiry the land shall become a new state, rather than being added to another, and all new land is territory controlled by the federal government until further notice.</p>
      <p>From the Ohio river to canada is new territory being controlled by the federal government.</p>
      <p>Once a territory has about 5,000 people they can get someone to delegate for their intrests in congress, at 60,000 they can now apply for statehood and be seen as another US state.</p>
      <p>*Important for later - There is also a ban on slavery in northwst territories, slowly fading slavery from the north while it still thrives in the south*</p>
