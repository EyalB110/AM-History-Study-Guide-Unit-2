      <p> America replaces the AOC with a new constitution that increases power to the federal government, splitting power betweeb three chambers.
      </p>
      <h3>Economic Problemns and Shays Rebellion - </h3>
      <p>Shortage of money, including gold, silver, and other types of currency. Banks only take those types of currency, states are also in insane debt and refused to tax their citizens.</p>
      <p>These economic problems ended up causing foreclosure, many middle and lower class Americans are losing their propertiers.</p>
      <p>Foreclosure - A loan taken out for land</p>
      <h5>Shays Rebellion - </h5>
      <p>An uprising is started in Massechusetts and was a veteran that lost his buisness and land to foreclosure, the uprising included many other veterans and people affected by forclosure.</p>
      <p>Massechusetts calls in an army from the federal government to help with the crisis, but they cannot get any money because they cannot tax the poeple but the states are the only ones who have that power, only one state contributes to helping.</p>
      <p>The rebellion was soon taken down by a small private army</p>
      <p>Shays Rebellion made people start thinking about a different path of government.</p>
      <h3>The Great Comprimise (The Connecticut Comprimise) - </h3>
      <p>Created a bicameral legislature, and the more people that live in the state the more representatives in the HOR. </p>
      <h3>TThe Constitutional Convention - </h3>
      <p>20% of the population in the US are slaves, mostly in the south but started dissapearing in the north.</p>
      <p>Three-Fifths of every slave is counted as a person towaards the census, this gives more representation for the state but the northern states are scared that the southern states will have more power in government.</p>
      <p>There was a thought in the convention about stopping the slave trade, but a law was passed saying congress cannot touch the slave trade in 20 years, 20 years later they ban the slave trade.</p>
      <p>The Constitution made another branch of government and created the leader of the executive branch, the president.</p>
      <p>Set a system of checks and balances, making sure no branch has more power.</p>
      <p>The founders of the constitution put barriers between the democratic will of the people and how the government looks, including senators, as senators are chosen by the state legislatures rather than the people.</p>
      <p>Electoral Collage is how the president is chosen, there are delegates that represent the people of their state and draw their votes for what the people have chosen.</p>
