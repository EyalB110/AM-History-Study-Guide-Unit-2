      <h2> Disagreement between those favoring states</h2>
      <h3>Political Developments - </h3>
      <p>Americans need to ratify the constitution, Americans need to voe on if they want the constitution.</p>
      <p>The Articles of confederation need every state to agree to change anything, the Constitutional convention says that 9/10 states vote yes then the constitution will be adopted in that state.</p>
      <p>Federalists want the constitution and are mostly made up of the poor peole who didnt want their rights to be trampled over by the rich.</p>
      <h3>Bill of Rights - </h3>
      <p>The federalists included the BOR to the constitution to help limit the power of government and protect indivitual peoples rights, st the time this included 10 amendments.</p>
      <p>*Most important amendment, 10th amendent - any rights not explicitly given to the federal government is given to the states.</p>
      <p>By 1790 the constitution was signed.</p>
      <h3>Womens Republican Rights - </h3>
      <p>Republiacan motherhood is started - it says that the job of a woman is to pass on the new values of republicanism into their children and continue the legacy.</p>
      <p>John Adam's wife, Abigail Adams, taught the kids at home while John went out and took on the role as a mother teaching their kids and caring for them while John is out doing political things, some letter were found from between her and John in todays time showing that she was as smart as him and emphasised that John should not forget thr womens rights.</p>
      <h3>Presidency - </h3>
      <p>George Washington won the vote by a landslide and served two terms, and made it a social norm for presidents to have teo terms.</p>
      <p>The Judiciary Act created the sepreme court and gave it some power to force the executive to do things.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet was also created to be the advisory counsel for the president.</p>
      <p>By the election of John Adams distinct political parties emerged, the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans, or Dem-Reps.</p>
      <p>Federalists supported a strong federl government, and Dem-Reps wanted the states to have more power and limit the government more.</p>
      <h3>Alien & Sedition Acts (1798) - </h3>
      <p>Passed under John Adams (Federalist)</p>
      <p>Alien Act: raised residency for citizenship from 5 → 14 years; aimed to weaken immigrant support for Democratic-Republicans.</p>
      <p>Sedition Act: made it illegal to criticize the gov’t → fines & jail for journalists (e.g. James Callender).</p>
      <p>Seen as unconstitutional, but upheld by Federalist courts, showed deepening Federalist vs. Democratic-Republican divisions.</p>
      <h3>Showed deepening Federalist vs. Democratic-Republican divisions - </h3>
      <p>Goals: strengthen national economy, gain elite support, unify states under federal government.</p>
      <p>Debt: fund national debt at face value ($54M) + assume state debts ($21.5M) → tied wealthy creditors to federal government.</p>
      <p>Excise Tax (1791): taxed goods (esp. whiskey), hit rural/frontier communities.</p>
      <p>Bank of the U.S. (1791): national bank, gov’t major stockholder, could regulate economy & credit.</p>
      <p>Jeffersonians: unconstitutional (strict construction), Federalists: constitutional (loose construction, Precedent for federal power expansion.</p>
      <h3>Whiskey Rebellion (1794) - </h3>
      <p>Rural PA farmers resisted whiskey tax (whiskey = drink, export, barter currency), tax collectors tarred/feathered.</p>
      <p>Washington raised 13,000 militia → rebellion collapsed before fighting, showed strong federal authority under Constitution (contrast w/ Shay’s Rebellion under Articles).</p>
