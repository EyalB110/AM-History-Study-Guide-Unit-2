      <h2>America’s First Constitution; The Articles of Confederation Unit 2.7 - </h2>

      <h3>Articles of Confederation (AOC)</h3>
      <p>The Americans used this to make the French think they were completely independent and self-ruling, in order to get supplies.</p>
      <p>Drafted in 1777 and ratified by all the states in 1781, the Articles created a central government that was small and weak.</p>
      <p>It created a weak central government and strong states, with a unicameral legislature (one chamber, one vote per state).</p>
      <p>The central government could raise an army, but not fund it, since it lacked the power to tax. Only states could tax.</p>
      <p>The people disliked central taxation (as under Britain), so they gave states the right to levy import taxes—even against other states.</p>

      <h3>New Land and State Hardships</h3>
      <p>States were in heavy debt. Larger states claimed western lands, angering smaller states. The Northwest Ordinance resolved this by making new land into new states, under federal control until statehood.</p>
      <p>From the Ohio River to Canada became federal territory. At 5,000 people a territory could send a delegate; at 60,000 it could apply for statehood.</p>
      <p><em>Important later:</em> slavery was banned in Northwest Territories, beginning its decline in the North.</p>
      <p>Eventually the AOC was replaced by a stronger Constitution with three branches of government.</p>

      <h2>Economic Problems and Shays’ Rebellion; Unit 2.8 - </h2>
      <p>Shortages of gold, silver, and currency led to foreclosures. Farmers and veterans lost property.</p>

      <h4>Shays’ Rebellion</h4>
      <p>In Massachusetts, Daniel Shays (a veteran) led an uprising against foreclosures. The federal government couldn’t help, since it had no taxation power. The rebellion was crushed by a private army, but it pushed people to rethink government structure.</p>

      <h3>The Great Compromise (Connecticut Compromise)</h3>
      <p>Created a bicameral legislature: representation by population in the House of Representatives, and equal representation in the Senate.</p>

      <h3>The Constitutional Convention</h3>
      <p>20% of the U.S. population were enslaved (mostly in the South). The Three-Fifths Compromise gave southern states more representation. Congress agreed not to touch the slave trade for 20 years.</p>
      <p>The Constitution created an executive branch (President), checks and balances, and indirect democracy (Senators chosen by legislatures, Electoral College for presidents).</p>

      <h2>Ratification and Political Developments; Unit 2.9 - </h2>
      <p>The Articles required unanimity for changes, but the Constitution required only 9 of 13 states. Federalists supported the Constitution, Anti-Federalists opposed it.</p>

      <h3>Bill of Rights</h3>
      <p>To win support, the Federalists added the Bill of Rights (10 amendments). The 10th Amendment reserved powers not granted to the federal government for the states.</p>

      <h3>Women’s Republican Rights</h3>
      <p>Republican motherhood stressed women’s role in teaching civic values. Abigail Adams urged John Adams not to “forget the ladies.”</p>

      <h3>Washington’s Presidency</h3>
      <p>George Washington set the two-term precedent. The Judiciary Act created the Supreme Court. The Cabinet was formed as presidential advisors.</p>

      <h3>Emergence of Political Parties</h3>
      <p>By John Adams’ presidency, Federalists (strong federal power) and Democratic-Republicans (state power) had formed.</p>

      <h3>Alien & Sedition Acts (1798)</h3>
      <p>Alien Act: raised residency for citizenship from 5 → 14 years (weakened immigrant support for Democratic-Republicans).</p>
      <p>Sedition Act: illegal to criticize government (jail & fines for journalists). Seen as unconstitutional but upheld by Federalist courts.</p>

      <h3>Hamilton’s Financial Program</h3>
      <p>Goals: strengthen economy, unify states, tie wealthy creditors to government. Fund national debt, assume state debts, impose excise taxes (like on whiskey), and establish the Bank of the U.S.</p>

      <h3>Whiskey Rebellion (1794)</h3>
      <p>Pennsylvania farmers resisted whiskey taxes. Washington led 13,000 militia; rebellion collapsed without fighting. Showed strong federal authority under the Constitution (contrast to Shays’ Rebellion).</p>
